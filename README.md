# My Portfolio

## Description

The object of this assignment was to essential build our own site from scratch copying an already set design. The last few weeks in this class, we learned various things in HTML and CSS and this homework required that we use all the skills we've come by thus far. I created three HTML pages title index, portfolio and contact. Each of the HTML pages also had their own css pages. On top of my css, we were also asked to use bootstrap for some of the layout.

Throughout the setup, we were asked to git commit often for each new step that we have done. This project has helped solidify all the things Ive learned thus far.
